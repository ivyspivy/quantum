# quantum
Trying out some quantum algorithms with IBM's QX SDK and API.
Feel free to use these for a starting point, hopefully the comments are clear enough
so that you can follow the reasoning. As for the mathematics, I link the sources that
I use so that you can reference them as well. 

I am starting to use Rigetti's Forest toolkit. I will distinguish these files from the IBM files by naming them "rigetti<NAME>" as the file name.
